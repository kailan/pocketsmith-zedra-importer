# PocketSmith Payslip Importer

This script imports "interactive payslips" generated by [Zedra](https://www.zedra.com/) Payroll into [PocketSmith](https://www.pocketsmith.com/).

NOT recommended for use by anyone who is not a confident developer as any mistakes could result in incorrect financial records.

### Usage

1. Extract your interactive payslip from the Zedra payroll portal as JSON and save it to `payslip.json` in the root directory of this project. If you can't figure out how to do this then you should not be using this tool.
2. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in your PocketSmith developer key, account name, payee names, and other settings:
    - `pocketSmithDeveloperKey`: Your PocketSmith developer key.
    - `transactionAccountName`: The name of the account in PocketSmith where the transactions will be imported.
    - `transactionsNeedReview`: Whether the transactions should be marked as needing review in PocketSmith.
    - `employerPayeeName`: The name of the employer. Used as the payee for the employer transactions.
    - `employeePayeeName`: The name of the payee that the final take-home pay will be attributed to.
    - `netPayCategory`: The category for the net pay transaction.
    - `payslipLineToCategoryNameMapping`: A map of payslip line names to PocketSmith category names. This allows you to categorize different types of earnings, deductions, etc.
3. Dry-run the script using `npm start < payslip.json` to verify that the output looks correct.
4. If everything looks good, run the script with `npm start -- --publish < payslip.json` to import the transactions into PocketSmith.

### Example Run

```bash
âžœ  pocketsmith-zedra-importer npm start < payslip.json

> pocketsmith-zedra-importer@1.0.0 start
> ts-node .
